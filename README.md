# MERN Stack Project

## Description
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application provides an intuitive interface for managing data stored in the backend. Key features include displaying data in a table format, viewing detailed information for specific entries, and performing CRUD operations with modals and toast notifications.

## Features
1. **Display Data Table**  
   - The main screen showcases a table displaying data fetched from the backend.
   - Each row represents a specific data entry.

2. **Detailed View Modal**  
   - Clicking on a row opens a modal with a detailed view of the selected entry.
   - This modal provides more information about the entry than what's displayed in the table.

3. **Update Entry Modal**  
   - A modal allows users to update the details of an existing entry.
   - Real-time validation ensures only valid data is submitted.

4. **Delete Confirmation Toast**  
   - Users can delete an entry with a confirmation toast.
   - This ensures accidental deletions are avoided.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
